Respected Sir/Ma'am :)
This ChatGPT Application has the API-Key of OpneAI in the Main_Activity.
You simply just have Open the OpenAI on Google Chrome and clik on the "API", After that go the API references section at the left top of the screen.
Then scroll the API references column and in the bottom right corner, cick to the "Completions".
Then copy the API-key from "Create Completion Heading" and then paste that API-Key in the Main_Activity Java code.
Then your Appplication will successfully run :) 
And If still you face some errors then e-mail me on "sanakayani024@gmail.com" ðŸ˜Šâœ¨
